# The State of Hotels in Egypt

## Project Overview: 
This project investigates the key factors influencing guest satisfaction across hotels in Egypt. Using real-world data collected from online booking platforms, we analyze variables like price, location, amenities, and review patterns to identify what truly matters to travelers. The study aims to support hospitality professionals in making data-informed improvements and guide tourists in choosing accommodations.

## Supervised By:

* Dr. Mohamed Taher ElRefaei

* TA Shereen Elfayoumi

* TA Nadine Elsaeed


## Dataset:
Source: Kaggle – Egypt Hotels Dataset

Rows: 947  I  Columns: 19

#### Content Includes:

* Hotel name, type, coordinates

* Check-in/out times

* Star rating, customer satisfaction score

* Review count

* Location rating

* Price range, amenities, and nearby attractions

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
Data from online review platforms containing real guest feedback and ratings.

### 2. Data Cleaning
* Outlier Handling: IQR method (capping instead of removal)

* Missing Values: Imputed using mean/mode or dropped if excessive

### 3. Correlation Analysis
#### Explored relationships between:

* Price and Satisfaction

* Review Count and Ratings

* Location Ratings

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
#### Used ANOVA and Pearson correlation and tested relationships like:

* Tourist location vs. Satisfaction (overall rating)

* Price per night vs. Satisfaction (overall rating)

* Review Count vs. Satisfaction (overall rating)

### 5. Visualization Utilized:

Scatter plots, Box plots, Violin plots, Bar charts, Histograms, and Heatmaps

## Key Findings:
* No strong correlation between price and rating — affordable hotels can offer excellent service.

* Hotels generally outperform vacation rentals in guest satisfaction.

* Location (tourist vs. non-tourist) doesn’t significantly affect satisfaction.

* More reviews ≠ better quality — high satisfaction is independent of popularity.

* Price diversity: Vacation rentals have broader pricing, while hotels offer more consistency.

* Moderate correlation between price and satisfaction (r ≈ 0.373).

## Limitations:
* Subjectivity in ratings

* Possible sampling bias toward popular destinations

* Unmeasured confounding factors (e.g., economic shifts, global events)

* Contextual gaps due to external events (e.g., pandemics)

## Conclusion:
This analysis provides actionable insights for Egypt’s hotel industry. Value, consistency, and service quality are more influential than location or pricing alone. These findings encourage data-driven strategies for improving guest experiences across all types of accommodations.
